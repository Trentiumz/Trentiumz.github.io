    <p>\(a^{-b}=\frac1{a^b}\) and \(a^0=1\)</p>
    <p>A curve of best fit is the curve that best fits the data, and is sometimes nonlinear. A quadratic relation is a relation of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\), and its graph is a parabola (a U-shaped curve). Its vertex is the maximum/minimum, and its axis of symmetry passes through it. </p>
    <p>By taking finite differences, one can often see if the data is mostly linear, quadratic, or neither. If first differences are equal, it is linear, if second differences are equal, it is quadratic. </p>
    <p>\(y=a(x-h)^2+k\) shifts the graph right by h units, stretches the graph vertically by a factor of a and shifts the graph up by k units. </p>
    <p>A graph of the form \(y=a(x-r)(x-s)\) has roots at \(x=r\) and \(x=s\), and is called the zeros form. A graph of the form \(y=a(x-h)^2+k\) is called vertex form and has a vertex at \((h, k)\)</p>

    <p class="h1">Question</p>
    <p>A country can either make bread or invest in toppings. For every additional loaf of bread
      that it makes, it must make 2 less toppings, and for each reduction in one loaf that the country makes, it can make 2 more toppings. Assume that this country has a constant opportunity
      cost (i.e, the number of toppings that it must give up for each loaf of bread is constant). The
      country currently makes 20 loaves of bread and 36 toppings, with each loaf of bread selling for 2 dollars.
      For each additional topping it makes, each loaf of bread will be worth 50 cents more. How many loaves
      bread should the country sell to maximize revenue?</p>

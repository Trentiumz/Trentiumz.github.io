    <p>The circumcenter is the point at which the perpendicular bisectors meet. It is equidistant to each of the vertices. The centroid is the point where the 3 medians meet, also known as the center of mass. The orthocenter is the intersection of the 3 altitudes. The incenter is the point where all angle bisectors meet, it is equidistant to each of the sides. </p>
    <p>The area of a trapezoid is the average of the parallel sides multiplied by its height. If the midpoints of each side of a quadrilateral are joined, then the result is a parallelogram. </p>
    <p>A chord is a line segment joining two points on a curve, and a diameter of a circle intersects the center. The right bisector of a chord always passes through the center of the circle. Three non-collinear points determine the circle. The circumcenter of a circle passes through all vertices of the triangle, and its center is the circumcenter of the triangle. The incircle is the circle touching each side, and its center is the incenter. </p>
